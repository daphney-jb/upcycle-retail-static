        <h2>Fashion with Purpose</h2>
        <p>Everloop Boutique was born from a simple belief: beautiful fashion shouldn't cost the earth. Founded in 2019, we started as a small pop-up shop with a mission to give pre-loved clothing a second chance.</p>
        <p>Today, we're a thriving community of conscious consumers who understand that every purchase is a vote for the kind of world we want to live in. Our customers aren't just shoppers—they're changemakers who care deeply about the planet.</p>
        <p>Our team carefully curates each piece in our collection, ensuring quality, style, and sustainability go hand in hand. We partner with local artisans to upcycle vintage fabrics into unique accessories, giving new life to materials that would otherwise end up in landfills.</p>
        <p>Whether you're hunting for the perfect vintage jacket or looking to refresh your wardrobe sustainably, we're here to help you look good while doing good.</p>
